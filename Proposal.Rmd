## The tentative project title:
World Life Expectancyâ€”Live to thrive
 
## The motivation for this project:
It's a survival instinct in blood that keeps us asking ourselves, how do we live, and how do we live longer. People in different regions have different life expectancies. Even in New York, life expectancy varies over regions due to different economic statuses, different infrastructures, etc. It is natural to wonder about the factors that could potentially have the most influential impact on life expectancy: social-economic factors, public health factors, or both.
